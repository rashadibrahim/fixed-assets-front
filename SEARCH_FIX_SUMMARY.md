# Search Focus and Refresh Issues - FIXED

## Problem
The search functionality in warehouse and asset management was causing:
1. **Focus loss** - Search input lost focus on every keystroke
2. **Page refresh** - Component re-rendered causing the entire page to refresh
3. **Poor UX** - Search was very slow and unresponsive

## Root Cause
The issue was that **WarehouseManagement** and **AssetManagement** components were making API calls on every search keystroke change, causing:
- Component re-renders
- Input focus loss
- Slow performance
- Poor user experience

This was different from **BranchManagement** which uses client-side filtering and works smoothly.

## Solution Applied

### 1. DynamicSearchableSelect Component Improvements
- **Increased debounce time** from 300ms to 500ms for better UX
- **Improved focus management** to prevent losing focus during search
- **Better loading state management** to prevent multiple simultaneous requests
- **Added duplicate search prevention** to avoid making the same API call twice

### 2. WarehouseManagement Component Fix
- **Removed debounced API search** that was causing re-renders
- **Changed to client-side filtering** like BranchManagement
- **Load all warehouses once** and filter them locally
- **Updated filter logic** to include search term matching:
  - English name (`name_en`)
  - Arabic name (`name_ar`) 
  - English address (`address_en`)
  - Arabic address (`address_ar`)

### 3. AssetManagement Component Fix
- **Removed debounced API search** for search terms
- **Changed to client-side search filtering** while keeping server-side category filtering
- **Updated filter logic** to include search term matching:
  - English name (`name_en`)
  - Arabic name (`name_ar`)
  - Product code (`product_code`)

## Technical Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `src/components/ui/dynamic-searchable-select.tsx`
2. `src/components/WarehouseManagement.jsx`
3. `src/components/AssetManagement.jsx`

### Key Code Changes:

#### WarehouseManagement.jsx
```javascript
// OLD - API search on every keystroke
useEffect(() => {
  loadData(debouncedSearchTerm);
}, [debouncedSearchTerm]);

// NEW - Client-side filtering
const filteredWarehouses = (warehouses || []).filter(warehouse => {
  const matchesBranch = !selectedBranch || selectedBranch === 'all' || warehouse.branch_id === parseInt(selectedBranch);
  const matchesSearch = !searchTerm || (
    (warehouse.name_en && warehouse.name_en.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())) ||
    (warehouse.name_ar && warehouse.name_ar.includes(searchTerm)) ||
    (warehouse.address_en && warehouse.address_en.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())) ||
    (warehouse.address_ar && warehouse.address_ar.includes(searchTerm))
  );
  return matchesBranch && matchesSearch;
});
```

#### AssetManagement.jsx
```javascript
// OLD - API search on every keystroke
const debouncedSearchTerm = useDebounce(searchTerm, 500);
useEffect(() => {
  loadAssets(currentPage, debouncedSearchTerm, filterCategory);
}, [currentPage, debouncedSearchTerm, filterCategory]);

// NEW - Client-side search filtering
const filteredAssets = assets.filter(asset => {
  if (!searchTerm) return true;
  const searchLower = searchTerm.toLowerCase();
  return (
    (asset.name_en && asset.name_en.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower)) ||
    (asset.name_ar && asset.name_ar.includes(searchTerm)) ||
    (asset.product_code && asset.product_code.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower))
  );
});
```

## Result
✅ **Search inputs no longer lose focus**
✅ **No more page refreshes during search**
✅ **Instant search results** (client-side filtering)
✅ **Consistent behavior** across all management screens
✅ **Better user experience** - smooth and responsive search

## Performance Impact
- **Faster search response** - No network delay
- **Reduced server load** - Fewer API calls
- **Better UX** - Instant feedback as user types
- **More responsive interface** - No loading states during search
